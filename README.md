# Projects-2022


### QF 112 LM Project

This project was done by a small group of classmates and I in the spring of my freshman year(2021-2022).

We were tasked with using a list of independent variables to predict the independent variable life 
expectancy. This was done in my statistics class, where the project was actually framed as a competition
between groups, with the winner determined by mean squared error. My group used multiple techniques to 
created a model which placed top 3 in the class, of which results were indistinguishable at a
significance level of .1

A more detailed description of this project can be read in it's corresponding write-up.


### Bootstrapping Personal Project

This was a personal project that I worked on after school for a few weeks fall of 2022. It's less 
conclusive than the linear modeling project as I still continue to tinker on it, but it uses somewhat
complex iteration so I figured I would include it. 

The actual program is rather slow as it takes an excessive amount of samples, so I would suggest
just reading the writeup.
