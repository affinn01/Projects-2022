# Projects-2022


### QF 112 Linear Modeling Project

This project was done by a small group of classmates and I in the spring of my freshman year(2021-2022).

We were tasked with using a list of independent variables to predict the independent variable life 
expectancy. This was done in my statistics class, where the project was actually framed as a competition
between groups, with the winner determined by mean squared error. My group used multiple techniques to 
created a model which placed top 3 in the class, of which results were indistinguishable at a
significance level of .1

A more detailed description of this project can be read in it's corresponding write-up.
